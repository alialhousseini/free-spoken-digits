Project Roadmap & Report Outline
1. Introduction
Project Overview: Briefly describe the project's aim - building a classification model for spoken digit recognition.
Dataset Description: Introduce the Free Spoken Digit dataset.

2. Data Acquisition and Loading
Data Sourcing: Explain where and how the dataset was obtained.
Loading the Dataset: Detail the process of loading the audio files, including the use of Python libraries (e.g., os, wave).

3. Data Exploration and Preprocessing
Initial Data Exploration:
Visualize and listen to audio samples.
Analyze basic properties (sample rate, duration, etc.).
Preprocessing Steps:
Noise Reduction (if necessary).
Normalization: Ensuring consistent audio levels.
Data Augmentation: Methods like time stretching, pitch shifting, adding noise (optional, for improving model robustness).
Feature Extraction:
Extracting Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs), Chroma features, Spectral Contrast, Tonnetz (harmonic features).
Data Splitting: Splitting into training, validation, and test sets.

4. Model Development
Choice of Model: Discuss the selection of models suitable for audio classification (e.g., CNN, RNN, LSTM).
Model Architecture: Describe the architecture of the chosen model(s).
Training: Detail the training process, including hyperparameter tuning.

5. Model Evaluation and Selection
Evaluation Metrics: Define metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score).
Cross-Validation: Explain the process and results.
Model Comparison: Compare different models or configurations based on evaluation metrics.

6. Model Optimization
Hyperparameter Tuning: Techniques like grid search or random search.
Feature Selection: Determining the most effective set of features.
